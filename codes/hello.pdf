JAVASCRIPT

According to a study done at stack overflow, Javascript is the second most popular languange among developers.
Why should you care about learning it?

-Its in high demand. Having this skill can guarantee you a source of income
-you can build almost anything starting from web apps, mobile apps, desktop apps and web 3 apps
- Basically there are 2 routes to follow if you are using javascript for web development
    ✔Javascript on the browser for frontend applications
    ✔Javascript on the server to build backend

    So where does javascript  run?
    Javascript runs on the browser, any browser
    If you are using windows, open chrome and press f12(alternatively you can go to settings>inspect>developer tools>console)
    .. this will open dev tools
    ... navigate to the console
    ... type console.log("hello world")
    you will see the hello world output on your console.
    Brilliant! you have executed your first js code.

    So whats the history of this languange?
    It was developed in a company called netscape by a developer called Brendan 
    It was first called mocha but later changed to javascript for commercial purposes since java was very popular at that time
    N/B javascript is not related to java, the similar name was just for commercial purposes.
     -later, microsft developed internet explorer 2 which came with its own version of javascript called js script

     ✔Due to this, there was a problem. Two conflicting versions of javascript in the market!
     there had to be a standard
     -developers met in EUROPEAN COMPUTER MANUFACTURING ASSOCIATION i.e ECMA and held a conference to come up with a standard version of javascript
     - The result was ECMASCRIPT . ECMASCRIPT is just javascript
     - ECMA meets regularly till now to continue developing the languange
     - thats why you will here terms like ES5, ES6, ES7 features of javascript
      
      So what is ECMASCRIPT? IS IT JAVASCRIPT?
      ecmascript is the part  of javascript that defines things like keywords and reserved keywords
      - for loops and if statements in the languange
      - and Basically every other syntax rule

      BUT JAVASCRIPT IS MORE THAN ECMASCRIPT
      javascript has 3 major building blocks
      -ECMASCRIPT
      -DOM -document object model
      -BOM -browser object model

      this three are what make up javascript as a whole

      SO WHAT IS DOM?
      iTS AN api provided by the browser. It allows us to get access to html elements e.g div and manipulate them using javascript code
      thats pretty powerful!
      It basically allows us to add interactivity to our websites
      -This is what allows us to make dynamic sites

      SO WHAT IS BOM?
      an api that allows us to interact with the browser
      -don't worry about this too much will talk about it

      WHO SHOULD LEARN JAVASCRIPT?
      anyone with a basic understanding of html and css
